          <h1 class="text-danger"> Domain names </h1>
            <p>
              Domain name is the address of a website that people type in the browser URL bar to visit it. If a website is a house, a domain name is an address that you can use to find it. When you enter a domain name in your web browser, it first sends a request to a global network of servers that form the Domain Name System (DNS). These servers then look up for the name servers associated with the domain and forward the request to those name servers. For example, if your website is hosted on Wordpress, then its name server information will be like this:
ns1.wordpress.com
ns2.wordpress.com
These name servers are computers managed by your hosting company. Your hosting company will forward your request to the computer where your website is stored. This computer is called a web server. It has special software installed (Apache, Nginx are two popular web server software). The web server now fetches the web page and pieces of information associated with it. Finally, it then sends this data back to the browser

           <h1 class="text-danger"> ICANN </h1>
            <p>
                Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages the domain names system. It is a non-profit organization that creates and implements the policies for domain names. ICANN gives permission to companies called Domain Name Registrars for selling domain names. These domain registrars are allowed to make changes to domain names registry on your behalf. Domain name registrars can sell domain names, manage its records, renewals, and transfers to other registrars.

            </p>
          <h1 class="text-danger"> Why do we use it? </h1>
            <p>
               The Internet is a giant network of computers connected to each other through a global network of cables. Each computer on this network can communicate with other computers. To identify them, each computer is assigned an IP address. It is a series of numbers that identify a particular computer on the internet. A normal IP address is quite difficult to remember. Domain names were invented to solve this problem.Now if you want to visit a website, then you don’t need to enter a long string of numbers. Instead, you can visit it by typing an easy to remember domain name in your browser’s address bar. For example, wordpress.com.
