        <p>
          The Internet is the defining technology of our time and historic revolution in communications for the human race that is changing the world. The internet enables millions of people with personal computers to communicate and connect. It is in fact the telecommunications infrastructure for the 21st century.  Millions of people around the world are now online every day to exchange messages, conduct business, meet people and find information, free from the limits of time, distance and even tyranny. Computer communication can also be a tool of war to manage material and manpower. In financial importance, IA found that the internet is the fourth largest sector in the U.S., creating 6 million director jobs and more than $2 trillion in GDP in 2018. It is a key component of our culture and civilization and yet no one really controls it. The Internet is practically indispensable and no invention in history has grown so fast to touch so many lives.
