          <h1 class="text-danger"> IP Address </h1>
            <p>
                An IP address (short for Internet Protocol address) is used to identify computers on the Internet. It works like a return address would on a piece of mail. Examples: 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4) or 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6). 
            </p>
           <h1 class="text-danger"> Packets </h1>
            <p>
               A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet. Similar to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content (or data) being transferred. When the packets reach their destination, they are reassembled into a single file or other contiguous block of data.

            </p>
           <h1 class="text-danger"> Routing </h1>
            <p>
                Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.
Routers work in the following way: when a router receives a packet, it reads the headers* of the packet to see its intended destination, like the way a train conductor may check a passenger's tickets to determine which train they should go on. It then determines where to route the packet based on information in its routing tables.

            <h1 class="text-danger"> Why do we use it </h1>
            <p>
                When you put a website on the Internet you have a number of options when it comes to hosting. Most people don’t go through the expense or the hassle of setting up their own server and effectively becoming their own web host, so their other options would be to use a dedicated server or shared web hosting.
            </p>
            <p>
                With shared web hosting there may be hundreds or even thousands of websites on the same server. With that many websites on one server, all of those websites will often share one IP address. There are some inherent dangers when your website is sharing an IP address with hundreds of other websites. Sometimes people do shady things on the Internet and if you are sharing an IP address with a website that is blocked or blacklisted, your site may suffer as well. A unique IP address offers a layer of protection and greater security and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully. if a data transfer encounters network congestion due to multiple simultaneous transfers, the remaining packets can be rerouted through a less congested path.

            </p>
            <p>
              Routing is the hub around which all of IP connectivity revolves. At the simplest level, routing establishes basic internetwork communications, implements an addressing structure that uniquely identifies each device, and organizes individual devices into a hierarchical network structure.The router has become the primary control point in the increasingly complex network environment, holding responsibility for service quality and security, monitoring and efficiency, and other attributes that allow networks to add value. If you control the routers, you control the network.
